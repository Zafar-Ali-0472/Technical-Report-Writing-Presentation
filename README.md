End-of-Term Project: Analysing Cultural Norms and Social Issues in a Movie or TV Series.

The purpose of this project was to critically analyze a movie or TV series of our choice, focusing on various aspects related to cultural norms, societal issues, and
biases. By examining the content, I had to explore how the creators (writers,directors, actors) portray and address these themes. My choice of the movie was " Dead Poets Society (1989)"
